# EmojiFace

-------
OLD REPO. Switched to a Swift project with Objective-C and Objective-C++ files, rather than an Objective-C project.
-------

Beginnings of my final project for Computational Photography. Still experimenting with a framework that will detect faces and emotions. Will use keypoints and emotion data to superimpose and transform the respective emoji to a person's face (possibly multiple faces) in real time.
